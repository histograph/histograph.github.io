## Architecture diagram

The Histograph architecture diagram is made with Adobe Illustrator:

  - [`images/architecture.ai`](images/architecture.ai)
  - [`images/architecture.svg`](images/architecture.svg)

However, SVGs exported by Illustrator are quite messy. Running `create-include-svg.svg` fixes font styles, and adds links to GitHub repositories:

  - [`includes/architecture.svg`](includes/architecture.svg)
