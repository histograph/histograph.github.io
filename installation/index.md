This document explains how to install and configure all the essential components Histograph needs to run:

  1. Install Neo4j
  2. Install Elasticsearch
  3. Install Redis
  4. Install Histograph
  5. Create and import data files

## Neo4j

### Installation

[Download and install Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/), or use your favorite package manager. Or Homebrew:

    brew install neo4j

### Histograph Neo4j plugin

Histograph depends on a [server plugin](https://github.com/histograph/neo4j-plugin) for some of its graph queries. Before downloading and building the plugin, we need to tell Neo4j to create a `/histograph` endpoint. Open `neo4j-server.properties`, and add the following line:

    org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.waag.histograph.plugins=/histograph

Afterwards, ou can install this plugin like this:

    git clone https://github.com/histograph/neo4j-plugin.git
    cd neo4j-plugin
    ./install.sh

This script is for MacOS, on other systems, run `mvn package` yourself to build the Neo4j plugin, copy the resulting JAR file to Neo4j's plugin directory, and restart Neo4j.

In a Debian install, the plugin directory is located at `/usr/share/neo4j`.

## Elasticsearch

### Installation

Install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch). With Homebrew, this is easy:

    brew install elasticsearch

### Configuration

Currently, Histograph does not create its own mappings. Please put Histograph's `default-mapping.json` in  the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

With Homebrew, this file is located here:

    /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/:version/config

Download `default-mapping.json` from GitHub, and copy the file:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/histograph/schemas/master/elasticsearch/default-mapping.json
      mv default-mapping.json /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/:version/config

And, add the following lines to `elasticsearch.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
index.analysis.analyzer.lowercase:
  filter: lowercase
  tokenizer: keyword
{% endhighlight %}

## Redis

With Homebrew `brew install redis`, [redis.io](http://redis.io/download) otherwise.

## Histograph

### Configuration

All Histograph components depend on the [histograph-config](https://github.com/histograph/config) module, which  specifies a set of (overridable) default options. However, some options must always be specified manually: histograph-config loads the default configuration from [`histograph.default.yml`](https://github.com/histograph/config/blob/master/histograph.default.yml) and merges this with a required user-specified configuration file. You can specify the location of your own configuration file in two ways:

1. Start the Histograph module with the argument `--config path/to/config.yml`
2. Set the `HISTOGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable to the path of the configuration file:

{% highlight bash %}
export HISTOGRAPH_CONFIG=/Users/bert/code/histograph/config/histograph.bert.yml
{% endhighlight %}

This configuration file should at least specify the following options:

{% highlight yaml %}
api:
  dataDir: /var/histograph/data   # Directory where API stores data files.
  admin:
    name: histograph              # Default Histograph user, is created
    password: passwðŸšœrd           # when starting API the first time.

neo4j:
  user: neo4j                     # Neo4j authentication (leave empty when
  password: password              # running Neo4j without authentication)

import:
  dirs:
    - ../data                     # List of directories containing Histograph
    - ...                         # datasets - used by import tool
{% endhighlight %}

Please see the [histograph-config](https://github.com/histograph/config) repository on GitHub to see the default options specified by `histograph.default.yml`.

### Core

Histograph Core reads messages from Redis, and syncs Neo4j and Elasticsearch.

    git clone https://github.com/histograph/core.git
    cd core
    npm install
    node index.js

You can specify the location of your configuration file by specifying its location using the `--config` argument, or by setting the `HISTOGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable.

### API

Histograph API exposes a search API, as well as an API to upload and download datasets. The search API reads from Elasticsearch and Neo4j; the dataset API allows users to upload datasets, reads NDJSON files and writes messages to the Redis queue.

    git clone https://github.com/histograph/api.git
    cd api
    npm install
    node index.js

API can also be started with the `--config` command line argument.

Afterwards, the API will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Download or create NDJSON files

A Histograph dataset consists of a directory containing three files: two NDJSON files containing the dataset's PITs and relations, and a JSON file containing dataset metadata.

- Use [Histograph Data](https://github.com/histograph/data) to download and create NDJSON files from sources like the [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names](getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/) and [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/).
- [Heritage & Location datasets](https://github.com/erfgoed-en-locatie/data)
- Or, you can create NDJSON files yourself, from your own data.

To use Histograph Data to download and compile a default set of Histograph NDJSON files, do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/histograph/data.git
    cd data
    npm install
    node index.js tgn geonames

### Import data

With [histograph-import](https://github.com/histograph/import) you can upload local Histograph datasets to a remote (or local) instance of Histograph API. The import tool looks inside all directories specified by `config.import.dirs`. Datasets must follow the Histograph dataset naming convention:

- One dataset per directory;
- Each directory contains must contain a dataset JSON file, and a PITs or relations NDJSON file (or both):
  - `dataset1/dataset1.dataset.json`
  - `dataset1/dataset1.pits.ndjson`
  - `dataset1/dataset1.relations.ndjson`

For example, the GeoNames dataset looks like this:

  - `geonames/geonames.dataset.json`
  - `geonames/geonames.pits.ndjson`
  - `geonames/geonames.relations.ndjson`

To download and run histograph-import, do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/histograph/import.git
    cd import
    npm install
    node index.js tgn geonames ...

Without specifying one or more datasets as command line arguments, running `node indes.js` will import _all_ available datasets.

## Custom ontology and schemas

By default, Histograph's default configuration contains a [set of types and relations](https://github.com/histograph/config/blob/master/histograph.default.yml#L56). You can overwrite these by precifying your own types and relations in your user configuration file.
